Thanks for sharing your code and setup! Based on the project proposal, your current staff frontend/backend/JS handles:

* Staff login & access control
* Viewing/searching applications
* Viewing application details with documents and QR code (if approved)

---

### What your staff **can do now**:

* See all applications
* Search applications by type/status
* View detailed info & docs for each application

---
